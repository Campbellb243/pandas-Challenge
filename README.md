During this project, I dove into the nitty-gritty of school data, finding creative ways to present the information. It was a bit of a rollercoaster because I was figuring out how to piece together functions and different types of tables. Yep, I made some mistakes, but you know what they say â€“ you live and learn. This project definitely ate up a chunk of my time, but big thank you to my teachers and older brother for helping me through my coding blocks. I also received some help from the Xpert Assistant courtesy of the UCI Bootcamp. Hope you enjoy checking out the project as much as I enjoyed wrapping it up!
